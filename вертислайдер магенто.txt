Go to the the file app/design/frontend/Vendor/Theme/etc/view.xml

We can see a variable navdir.

This variable has ability to change the thumbnails alignment in Fotorama.

By default it is set as:

<var name="navdir"> horizontal</var>

Change the code like this:

<var name="navdir"> vertical</var>

to make the thumbnails as vertical.
